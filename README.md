# boltzmann_app
- 👋 A simple program that calculates population distribution using the Boltzmann Distribution. 
- 💾 This is the 1.0 version.
- ❓ Useful for calculating distributions between species A and B or the total free energy between these two species. 
- ❗ Your data needs to be in kJ/mol.K unit. 
- 👓 I'm working to implement a unit conversion tool and improve your workflow (that is, if you need to add the free energies of the reactant and product components).
